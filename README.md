## Lab 11: Building Full-Stack Web Apps
Set up a basic webapp. (Will be used for Labs 12-17)

### Tasks
- Ensure that you can run the Spring app.
- Create a hello world route at /hello, and ensure that you can visit that route in your browser and see data come back.
- Create a route that turns words into UPPER CASE. For instance, I should be able to visit /capitalize/hello and get back the response HELLO, or I could visit /capitalize/this is Kinda Capitalized and get the response THIS IS KINDA CAPITALIZED.
- Write a unit test for the capitalization functionality of that route.
Create a route that reverses the order of the words in a query parameter. For example, if I visit /reverse?sentence=Hello world, it should return world Hello.
- Write a unit test for the word reversing functionality of the above route.

### Testing
- You can test this app be following the link to the test code, clone it, then add and edit to test to your liking.
